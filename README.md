# Yokai Slayer

Yokai Slayer is a 2D Samurai platformer made with HTML, CSS, JavaScript DOM Manipulation, and OOP. In our game, you must defeat 
multiple enemies (Yokai) until you reach the final boss. For our game, we considered many different situations such as sprite sheets 
for animations, collision logic, attack logic, movement mechanics, and win/lose conditions.



## Motivation: Why Yokai Slayer was created 

We chose to create a 2D platformer minigame to challenge ourselves and for our love of Japanese culture. Developing a 2D platformer 
presented a unique set of challenges that pushed us to enhance our programming and design skills. From rendering animated sprite 
sheets to level design and game mechanics, every aspect of Yokai Slayer required us to step out of our comfort zones and grow as developers.
